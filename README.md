# Retail-Customer-Segmentation-SQL
Project Overview:
This online retail company wants to understand different types of customers based on purchasing behavior, in order to improve marketing strategy, retention, and revenue growth.

Business Problem:
The marketing team is seeing a drop in engagement. I, a junior analyst, used SQL to identify at-risk customers and VIP spenders to help them target their budget more effectively.
